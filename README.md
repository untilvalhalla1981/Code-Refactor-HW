# Code-Refactor-HW
Refactoring HTML and CSS code to increase accessibility on an existing webpage
There is only one set of commits beyond the initial commit as I was having trouble pushing those commits to my original repository. The original repos name was Accessibility for the Masses which I was committing my changes regularly or so I thought. I obviosly had done something wrong cause that repo did not have any of my commits in it beyond the initial commit. So I started from scratch and created a brand new repo and saved my final commits in it. Hopefully this doesn't affect my grade too much. I think the lesson to be learned here is that I had a problem and figured out how to fix it without completely losing all the work I had done and now I know for next time what I did wrong.
